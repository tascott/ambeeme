#Hackathon - AmbeeMe

AmbeeMe was a project built in a few hours as part of a hackathon. Built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, it uses live webcams via iFrames to 'set the scene' - users can choose from different views and different soundscapes to be transported to another place.

Unfortunately due to restrictions from the webcam provider, the functionality is reduced when hosted online.

###Built With...

- HTML/CSS
- iFrames

###The Journey

- Used iFrame and dynamic URLs as workaround.
